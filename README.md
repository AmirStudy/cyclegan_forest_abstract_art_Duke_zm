# cyclegan_forest_abstract_art_Duke_zm
This is the code corresponding to my Duke AI for Art Competition submission and blog post [CycleGANs to Create Computer-Generated Art](https://medium.com/@zachmonge). The weights for the trained model can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u0bt5ws99rkm6qv/AACwLG_rQ6XrHv-Z7z3xN3tfa?dl=0). All of the generated images here can be found in this repository in the zip files.
